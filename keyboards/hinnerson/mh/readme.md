=========

A split 65% staggered keyboard made by Martin Hinnerson.

Keyboard Maintainer: Martin Hinnerson
Hardware Supported: Pro Micro

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make hinnerson/mh/rev1:default65

Example of flashing this keyboard:

    make hinnerson/mh/rev1:default65:avrdude

Handedness detection is already hardwired onto the PCB, so no need to deal with `EE_HANDS` or flashing .eep files.
